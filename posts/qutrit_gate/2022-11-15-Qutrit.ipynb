    "So, why care about qutrits? Well, first thing to note is that they exist. Most quantum  systems in the real world, in contrast to quantum computing textbooks, are not two-level. Qutrits (three-level systems) and, more generally, qudits (d-dimensional systems) are omnipresent. Trapped ion quantum computers give one example where qudits naturally arise, see e.g. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08569](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08569). Another interesting example are superconducting qubits. In fact, a bare superconducting circuit is rather a harmonic oscillator and as such has infinitely many energy levels. Typically, an anharmonicity in the form of a Josephson junction is introduced, which allows to decouple the two lowest energy levels from the rest to give the familiar superconducting qubit. However, the higher energy levels are still there and can be fruitfully exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a theorist, more levels is a blessing. More states fit into the system of the same size (for example dimension of the qutrit state space scales as $3^n$ instead of $2^n$ for a qubit system) opening up novel optimization possibilities, here is just one example [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08973](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08973). An experimentator probably has mixed feelings about higher levels, because they are typically associated more noise and calibration overhead. Exploiting higher levels is therefore an promising yet challenging possibility. There are already many proofs of concept, see e.g. this result on using the third level in a superconducting circuit to improve the fidelity of the Toffoli gate [https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00558](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00558)."

Good, this explains why are there three terms in Euler's decomposition. (This technique of unsubtle parameter counting in fact extends far more generally. For example, it can be used to deduce a minimum amount of $CNOT$ gates necessary to compile an arbitrary $n$-qubit unitary, as I discussed [here](https://idnm.github.io/blog/machine%20learning/compilation/qiskit/paper%20review/2021/07/22/Machine-learning-compilation-of-quantum-circuits.html#Theoretical-lower-bound-and-quantum-Shannon-decomposition)).\n",

    "\n",
    "However, decompositions like $XZX$ are special in a sense that they are examples of Cartan (aka KAK) decompositions, hinging on the structure of the underlying $su(2)$ algebra. Decompositions of two-qubit gates into $CNOT$ gates and single-qubit rotations is another important example where KAK arise. I will not cover the subject here, but can recommend a quite readable introduction with applications to quantum gates [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010100](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010100).\n",

    "## A word about global phases\n",
    "Sure, global phases are normally ignored, and rightfully so, but there are situations where they are important. In our case, a global phase for a two-qubit gate leads to a non-trivial transformation when embedded in a qutrit. For example,\n",
    "$$(e^{i\\phi})^{01}=\\begin{pmatrix}e^{i\\phi}&0&0\\\\0&e^{i\\phi}&0\\\\0&0&1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "is surely not a global phase for a qutrit. You may try to decompose this gate into the elementary qutrit rotations introduced above+a true global phase gate for a qutrit. The result won't be trivial and actually involve more than one qutrit rotation. Therefore, we will take extra care to avoid global phases in the two-level gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decomposition refinement\n",
    "We would like to have a decomposition where all two-level matrices lie in $SU(2)$, i.e. have a unit determinant. This can be achieved as follows. First we factor out global phases from matrices $V$ and $W$, denote $V=e^{i\\phi_V}V_0, W=e^{i\\phi_W}W_0$. Then we write\n",
    "$$A=V'\\Sigma' W' \\ ,$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&V'=V_0\\\\\n",
    "&\\Sigma'=e^{i\\phi_V}e^{i\\phi_W}\\Sigma R_Z(2\\phi_V+2\\phi_W)\\\\\n",
    "&W'=R_Z(-2\\phi_V-2\\phi_W)W_0 \\ .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Unitary matrices $V',W'$ now have unit determinant. Matrix $\\Sigma'$ is diagonal and importantly $\\Sigma'_{00}=1$.  In order to enforce this constraint we included extra $R_Z$ factors in $\\Sigma'$ and $W'$. Note that $\\Sigma'_{11}$ is in general no longer real, but this will not pose a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce another factorization of matrix $A$ \n",
    "$$A=V'\\Sigma'W'$$\n",
    "and require $\\operatorname{det}V'=\\operatorname{det}W'=1$ and also $\\Sigma'_{00}=1$. Note that $\\Sigma'_{11}$ can not in general be real in such decomposition, because $\\operatorname{det}A$ is not real in general, but this won't pose a problem. This new factorization of $A$ leads to the following decomposition of $U$\n",
    "\\begin{align} U=(V')^{01} (H')^{12}(W')^{01} \\label{U prime} \\ . \\end{align}\n",
    "Because $\\operatorname{det}U=1$ it follows $\\operatorname{det}H'=1$. Therefore, the all two-level matrices now lie in $SU(2)$ and can be decomposed into three elementary rotations using e.g. Euler's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that three matrices from the $SU(2)$ have 9 parameters in total, one more than dimension of $SU(3)$. En extra redundancy can be described as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check directly that \\eqref{U prime} remains invariant. Using this freedom, we can fix one parameter in any of the three matrices."
