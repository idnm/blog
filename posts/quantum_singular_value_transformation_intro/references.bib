abstract = {An n-qubit quantum circuit performs a unitary operation on an exponentially large, 2n-dimensional, Hilbert space, which is a major source of quantum speed-ups. We develop a new “Quantum singular value transformation” algorithm that can directly harness the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized by quantum circuits with a very simple structure – typically using only a constant number of ancilla qubits – leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors. We show that our framework allows describing many quantum algorithms on a high level, and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to various quantum machine learning applications. We also devise a new singular vector transformation algorithm, describe how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum, and show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. Finally, we also prove a quantum lower bound on spectral transformations.},

Wiebe, STOC'19, arXiv:1806.01838], who introduced a quantum singular value
transformation (QSVT) framework for applying polynomial functions to
block-encoded matrices. The QSVT framework has garnered substantial recent
interest from the quantum algorithms community, as it was demonstrated by
[GSLW19] to encapsulate many existing algorithms naturally phrased as an
application of a matrix function. First, we posit that the lifting of quantum
singular processing (QSP) to QSVT is better viewed not through Jordan's lemma
(as was suggested by [GSLW19]) but as an application of the cosine-sine
decomposition, which can be thought of as a more explicit and stronger version
of Jordan's lemma. Second, we demonstrate that the constructions of bounded
polynomial approximations given in [GSLW19], which use a variety of ad hoc
approaches drawing from Fourier analysis, Chebyshev series, and Taylor series,
can be unified under the framework of truncation of Chebyshev series, and
indeed, can in large part be matched via a bounded variant of a standard
meta-theorem from [Trefethen, 2013]. We hope this work finds use to the
community as a companion guide for understanding and applying the powerful
framework of [GSLW19].},

@article{Martyn2021,
abstract = {Quantum algorithms offer significant speed-ups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms have recently been tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on the QSVT [Gily{\'{e}}n et al., ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which the QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ the QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how the QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.},

Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will likely not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parametrized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisioned for quantum computers, and they appear to the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain including the trainability, accuracy, and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges, and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

@article{Huang2021,
abstract = {Quantum technology has the potential to revolutionize how we acquire and process experimental data to learn about the physical world. An experimental setup that transduces data from a physical system to a stable quantum memory, and processes that data using a quantum computer, could have significant advantages over conventional experiments in which the physical system is measured and the outcomes are processed using a classical computer. We prove that, in various tasks, quantum machines can learn from exponentially fewer experiments than those required in conventional experiments. The exponential advantage holds in predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis on noisy states, and learning approximate models of physical dynamics. In some tasks, the quantum processing needed to achieve the exponential advantage can be modest; for example, one can simultaneously learn about many noncommuting observables by processing only two copies of the system. Conducting experiments with up to 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrate that a substantial quantum advantage can be realized using today's relatively noisy quantum processors. Our results highlight how quantum technology can enable powerful new strategies to learn about nature.},

coupled oscillators (e.g., {\$}2{\^{}}n{\$} masses coupled by springs). Our approach
leverages a mapping between the Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation and Newton's equation
for harmonic potentials such that the amplitudes of the evolved quantum state
encode the momenta and displacements of the classical oscillators. When
individual masses and spring constants can be efficiently queried, and when the
initial state can be efficiently prepared, the complexity of our quantum
algorithm is polynomial in {\$}n{\$}, almost linear in the evolution time, and
sublinear in the sparsity. As an example application, we apply our quantum
algorithm to efficiently estimate the kinetic energy of an oscillator at any
time. We show that any classical algorithm solving this same problem is
inefficient and must make {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}\backslashOmega(n){\}}{\$} queries to the oracle and, when the
oracles are instantiated by efficient quantum circuits, the problem is
BQP-complete. Thus, our approach solves a potentially practical application
with an exponential speedup over classical computers. Finally, we show that
under similar conditions our approach can efficiently simulate more general
classical harmonic systems with {\$}2{\^{}}n{\$} modes.},

(stochastic) gradient descent, the primary algorithm for machine learning. In
practice, we benchmark instances of large machine learning models from 7
million to 103 million parameters. We find that, in the context of sparse

Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation.

@article{Daley2022,
abstract = {The development of quantum computing across several technologies and platforms has reached the point of having an advantage over classical computers for an artificial problem, a point known as ‘quantum advantage'. As a next step along the development of this technology, it is now important to discuss ‘practical quantum advantage', the point at which quantum devices will solve problems of practical interest that are not tractable for traditional supercomputers. Many of the most promising short-term applications of quantum computers fall under the umbrella of quantum simulation: modelling the quantum properties of microscopic particles that are directly relevant to modern materials science, high-energy physics and quantum chemistry. This would impact several important real-world applications, such as developing materials for batteries, industrial catalysis or nitrogen fixing. Much as aerodynamics can be studied either through simulations on a digital computer or in a wind tunnel, quantum simulation can be performed not only on future fault-tolerant digital quantum computers but also already today through special-purpose analogue quantum simulators. Here we overview the state of the art and future perspectives for quantum simulation, arguing that a first practical quantum advantage already exists in the case of specialized applications of analogue devices, and that fully digital devices open a full range of applications but require further development of fault-tolerant hardware. Hybrid digital–analogue devices that exist today already promise substantial flexibility in near-term applications. The current status and future perspectives for quantum simulation are overviewed, and the potential for practical quantum computational advantage is analysed by comparing classical numerical methods with analogue and digital quantum simulators.},

We account for factors that are normally ignored such as noise, the need to make repeated attempts, and the spacetime layout of the computation. When factoring 2048 bit RSA integers, our construction's spacetime volume is a hundredfold less than comparable estimates from earlier works (Van Meter et al. 2009, Jones et al. 2010, Fowler et al. 2012, Gheorghiu et al. 2019). In the abstract circuit model (which ignores overheads from distillation, routing, and error correction) our construction uses 3n + 0.002n lg n logical qubits, 0.3n3 + 0.0005n3 lg n Toffolis, and 500n2 + n2 lg n measurement depth to factor n-bit RSA integers.

The challenge is that the computation must finish within a reasonable amount of time while being difficult enough that the small quantum scaling advantage would compensate for the large constant factor overheads associated with error-correction. We compute several examples of such runtimes using state-of-the-art surface code constructions under a variety of assumptions. We conclude that quadratic speedups will not enable quantum advantage on early generations of such fault-tolerant devices unless there is a significant improvement in how we would realize quantum error-correction. While this conclusion persists even if we were to increase the rate of logical gates in the surface code by more than an order of magnitude, we also repeat this analysis for speedups by other polynomial degrees and find that quartic speedups look significantly more practical.},

abstract = {Machine learning is frequently listed among the most promising applications for quantum computing. This is in fact a curious choice: Today's machine learning algorithms are notoriously powerful in practice, but remain theoretically difficult to study. Quantum computing, in contrast, does not offer practical benchmarks on realistic scales, and theory is the main tool we have to judge whether it could become relevant for a problem. In this perspective we explain why it is so difficult to say something about the practical power of quantum computers for machine learning with the tools we are currently using. We argue that these challenges call for a critical debate on whether quantum advantage and the narrative of 'beating' classical machine learning should continue to dominate the literature the way it does, and highlight examples for how other perspectives in existing research provide an important alternative to the focus on advantage.},

@article{Madsen2022,
abstract = {A quantum computer attains computational advantage when outperforming the best classical computers running the best-known algorithms on well-defined tasks. No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000 years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36 $\mu$s. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal. Gaussian boson sampling is performed on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using Borealis, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125.},

A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm. Quantum supremacy is demonstrated using a programmable superconducting processor known as Sycamore, taking approximately 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times, which would take a state-of-the-art supercomputer around ten thousand years to compute.},

This is crucial for machine learning with graph-structured data, and we show that the GBS-induced kernel performs remarkably well in classification benchmark tasks. We provide a theoretical motivation for this success, linking the extracted features to the number of r matchings in subgraphs.

Recently, a problem known as boson sampling has been shown to provide a pathway for solving a computationally intractable problem without the need for a full quantum computer, instead using a linear optics quantum set-up. In this work, we propose a modification of boson sampling for the purpose of quantum simulation. In particular, we show that, by means of squeezed states of light coupled to a boson sampling optical network, one can generate molecular vibronic spectra, a problem for which no efficient classical algorithm is currently known. We provide a general framework for carrying out these simulations via unitary quantum optical transformations and supply specific molecular examples for future experimental realization. A quantum simulation scheme is proposed for molecular vibronic spectra, a problem for which no efficient classical algorithm is currently known. The simulation is efficiently performed on a boson sampling machine simply by modifying the input state.},

abstract = {Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily$\backslash$'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.},

I discuss both the quantum circuit model, which is what we ultimately care about in practice but where our knowledge is radically incomplete, and the so-called oracle or black-box or query complexity model, where we've managed to achieve a much more thorough understanding that then informs our conjectures about the circuit model. I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of switching attention to sampling tasks, as was done in the recent quantum supremacy experiments. I make some skeptical remarks about widely-repeated claims of exponential quantum speedups for practical machine learning and optimization problems. Through many examples, I try to convey the "law of conservation of weirdness," according to which every problem admitting an exponential quantum speedup must have some unusual property to allow the amplitude to be concentrated on the unknown right answer(s).},

abstract = {The development of quantum computing across several technologies and platforms has reached the point of having an advantage over classical computers for an artificial problem, a point known as ‘quantum advantage'. As a next step along the development of this technology, it is now important to discuss ‘practical quantum advantage', the point at which quantum devices will solve problems of practical interest that are not tractable for traditional supercomputers. Many of the most promising short-term applications of quantum computers fall under the umbrella of quantum simulation: modelling the quantum properties of microscopic particles that are directly relevant to modern materials science, high-energy physics and quantum chemistry. This would impact several important real-world applications, such as developing materials for batteries, industrial catalysis or nitrogen fixing. Much as aerodynamics can be studied either through simulations on a digital computer or in a wind tunnel, quantum simulation can be performed not only on future fault-tolerant digital quantum computers but also already today through special-purpose analogue quantum simulators. Here we overview the state of the art and future perspectives for quantum simulation, arguing that a first practical quantum advantage already exists in the case of specialized applications of analogue devices, and that fully digital devices open a full range of applications but require further development of fault-tolerant hardware. Hybrid digital–analogue devices that exist today already promise substantial flexibility in near-term applications. The current status and future perspectives for quantum simulation are overviewed, and the potential for practical quantum computational advantage is analysed by comparing classical numerical methods with analogue and digital quantum simulators.},
