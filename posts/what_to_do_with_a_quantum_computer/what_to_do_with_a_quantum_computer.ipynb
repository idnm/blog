    "I got involved in the field of quantum computing relatively recently, in 2021. Before that, I didn't even know the field exists, let alone is taking off at the industrial scale. Yes, that's how robust my bubble was. After switching to quantum, I've tried to catch up on many levels -- from understanding the fundamentals, to getting up to speed with state of the art in hardware and algorithms, to carrying out some original research. Although I made some progress in all directions, you can imagine how fragmented and incomplete my picture of the field is. While there is still a ton of topics I'd like to understand better, one particular question have been sitting on the back of my mind for quite a while. ***What quantum computers will actually be good for?*** \n",

However, my exposure to the field already made me skeptical about many of the usually proposed applications. And I felt a pressing need to sort this out for myself. I now feel like I've mostly done my homework on this one, and here is what I found. For most of applications people discuss, prospects are pretty bleak.

    "# Types of quantum algorithms\n",
    "While there are great many specific versions of quantum algorithms (see a pretty comprehensive list at @zoo), they can be divided in a small number of broad categories. Back in 2003 the one and only Peter Shor wrote a short essay \"Why haven’t more quantum algorithms been found?\" @Shor2003. There he points out three main categories of quantum algorithms that were known to date.\n",

    "- Those using the quantum Fourier transform to find periodicity. The most famous example is the integer factoring algorithm due to Shor himself.\n",
    "- Algorithms similar or derived from Grover's search.\n",
    "- Algorithms for quantum simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, if you are interested why haven't more quantum algorithms been found, then according to Shor, it is probably because (1) quantum algorithms are so unusual that we do not have a good way to think about and invent them or (2) maybe there is just so much quantum algorithms, after all. You may wonder how much have changed in the past 20 years. \n",
    "Apparently, not that much. I would add three more positions to the list.\n",

    "- HHL algorithm.\n",
    "- NISQ \"algorithms\".\n",
    "- Algorithms for quantum data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To my understanding, the key new addition is the algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, discovered by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd and known as HHL algorithm. Another broad class of algorithms are NISQ algorithms, of which variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are the primary example. Finally, there is a new paradigm emerging which asks if we can do more with a quantum computer if our data is not classical, but quantum. I will discuss each of them in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as far as I can tell, that's basically it. Of course there have been a great deal of progress since 2003 in finding new applications for the existing primitives, refining their efficiency, and even building unifying frameworks (see e.g. @Martyn2021). But the broad classification outlined above still seems to apply.\n",

    "# What about the quantum advantage experiments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going through the list sketched above, let's briefly touch on the quantum advantage experiments. They certainly made a big splash, and it's important to understand their place in the grand scheme of things. So far, four groups reported quantum advantage. The fist and most known result comes from Google @Arute2019, then there were two academic groups in China @Wu2021-@Zhong2020, and last year it was Xanadu @Madsen2022. All these quantum advantage experiments were in *sampling*  tasks, meaning the goal was to sample from a certain probability distribution that is believed to be hard to sample from classically. While debates up to this day continue on whether these quantum advantage experiments can in fact be spoofed by a classical computer, I'm willing to assume that the sampling tasks of this kind give a real and short-term achievable quantum advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, *no useful applications of these sampling tasks* are known. This claim may sound too strong, as there are papers proposing different uses. For example, here is a review from Xanadu on possible applications of the Gaussian Boson Sampling @Bromley2019. Unfortunately, these are only heuristics. I'm not familiar with this subfield in any technical detail, so my argument is a behavioral one. Since these sampling experiments are already available, there is a huge incentive to produce practical results or at least come up with strong theoretical proposals. And this does not seem to be happening. Until I'll see a surge of activity in this a rea, I'll assume that these sampling experiments are unfortunately not useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must admit that this is bothering me. We found something, that quantum computers can do better than classical, why can't we use it? There must be a way, right? If we can't, is there a good explanation? I don't know one, but my discomfort was a bit relieved after reading a perspective by Harrow and Montanaro @Harrow2018. There, they introduce sampling experiments as computational analogs of Bell's experiments. Indeed, although [we know](https://idnm.github.io/blog/posts/entanglement/2021-07-12-entanglement.html) that quantum correlations can be stronger than classical, this does not lead directly to useful applications. Alright, I'll leave it at that. \n",

    "# NISQ algorithms don't work\n",
    "\n",
    "Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) algorithms @Bharti2022 account for most of the prospective applications of quantum computing, or at least you can get such an impression. There are NISQ algorithms for almost everything -- optimization, machine learning, simulation, and even NISQ versions of algorithms such as factoring or HHL. However, these \"algorithms\" are in fact heuristics that come with many theoretical and practical problems. Let's take a closer look.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variational quantum algorithms\n",
    "The main category of NISQ algorithms are variational quantum algorithms (VQA). The two most studied examples are Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). QAOA mostly focuses on ground state preparation for classical Ising Hamiltonians, which in facts covers a huge range of problems related to combinatorial optimization. VQE typically addresses Hamiltonians that arise from physics or chemistry, but largely does the same thing. I think the line between different types of VQA is quite blurry.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note title=\"Variational quantum algorithms\" style=\"minimal\" collapse=true}\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite generally, variational quantum algorithms aim to find a low energy state of some Hamiltonian $H$, that encodes the problem of interest. To do this, they start with a trivial quantum state $|0\\rangle$ and apply a parameterized quantum circuit to it $U(\\phi)|0\\rangle$. The resulting energy\n",
    "$$E(\\theta)=\\langle0|U^\\dagger(\\phi)HU(\\phi)|0\\rangle$$\n",
    "is minimized by adjusting parameters $\\theta$ classically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameterized quantum circuits $U(\\theta)$ can be informed by the problem as in QAOA, which seeks to approximate the adiabatic evolution, or completely problem-agnostic as in Hardware-Efficient ansatze.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my simple-minded and a bit cynic take on the idea behind variational quantum \"algorithms\", which I think would be better called variational quantum heuristics. Real quantum algorithms (without quotes) typically require circuits that are very deep. The current generation of quantum devices is pretty inaccurate, errors in two-qubit gates are of the order of $1\\%$. If you apply many gates, there will be nothing but noise at the output, and the computation is not useful. VQA approach the problem as follows. Alright, we do not know algorithms with shallow circuits, but let's try to build some. We'll prepare a quantum circuit that is sufficiently shallow to have a non-zero signal to noise ratio, and introduce *parameters* in there. While we do not know if any values of these parameters correspond to a useful computation, let's try to adjust them (classical optimization loop) so that the circuit does something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean, it is not a bad idea, and in many respects similar to how classical machine learning works. The problem seems to be, the current hardware only allows circuits so shallow, that you may optimize them all you want, you still wont get interesting results. Another practical problem is that evaluation of the energy function $E(\\theta)$ requires taking a ton of samples, which is slow and expensive. On the theoretical side, the loss landscape of most VQA appears to be pretty terrible, featuring barren plateaus and many bad local minimums. So even on a perfect hardware there are no guarantees for good results.\n",

    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum machine learning (QML) sounds quite fancy, but it shares much of the problems with VQA. Additional questions you might ask about QML models is whether can be superior to classical models at data encoding, expressivity, generalize better etc. To the best of my understanding, all claims that some QML models are somehow better than classical counterparts are heuristic, inconclusive, or only work for extremely artificial datasets. Moreover, let me quote a recent perspective @Schuld2022 by Schuld and Killoran titled \"Is quantum advantage the right goal for quantum machine learning?\"\n",

    "In other words, classical machine learning is so it sets a very high bar; it's hard to theoretically analyze how it works let alone prove quantum advantage; and we can't collect any meaningful empirical data on QML because the hardware is too noisy yet.\n",

Sure, we expect that the error rates will go down in the future, but even orders of magnitude improvements won't be enough. The principle answer to this challenge is error correction and fault-tolerant computation. By encoding the logical states in many physical qubits it is possible to arbitrarily suppress effective error rates. Asymptotically, the overhead of error correction in terms of physical to logical qubit ratio is polylog, and looks insignificant. However, the constant factors involved can be a deal breaker. What follows below is my coarse rundown based on papers @Babbush2020 and @Hoefler2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dominating paradigm of fault-tolerant computing the bottleneck is in production of the magic states. Roughly, one magic state is consumed to perform a single non-trivial computational primitive such as the Toffoli gate. Producing a single magic state involves hundreds of physical qubits, several code cycles, and hence a lot of the classical cofmputing power to guide the behavior of the quantum system. Rough estimations show that executing a single Toffoli gate can be 10 *orders* of magnitude slower than executing the NAND gate, its classical counterpart. This looks troublesome, doesn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "But won't this huge constant factor become irrelevant for large enough problem sizes? After all, we have a quadratic speed-up. Yes it will, but you should also consider how big that problem will be. Because the quantum computer starts with this huge handicap, it will probably take it years of runtime to catch up with a classical solver. So the problem sizes where you would see the quantum advantage are so large, that you'd have to wait a long long time to solve them even with a quantum computer. So this scenario does not look practical, in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "With very optimistic projections of how quantum computing will progress, problems with higher polynomial speed-ups, say quartic, become to look feasible. However, it appears that problems with exponential speed-up are really our best bet, and so we turn to them.\n",

Which means, quantum algorithms need to be done in logarithmic time. But in general, $\\log N$ time is not even sufficient to read in the problem specification, say $N\\times N$ matrix, or write out an solution, say an $N$-dimensional vector.\n",

An operator tranforming $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$ also requires an efficient quantum circuit implementation and can not correspond, say, to a general $N\\times N$ matrix.
