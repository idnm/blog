    "# Types of quantum algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are a great many specific versions of quantum algorithms (see a pretty comprehensive list at @zoo), they can be divided in a few broad categories. Back in 2003 the one and only Peter Shor wrote a short essay \"Why haven’t more quantum algorithms been found?\" @Shor2003.

    "\n",
    "By the way, if you are interested \"why haven't more quantum algorithms been found\", then according to Shor, it is probably because (1) quantum algorithms are so unusual that we do not have a good way to think about and invent them or (2) maybe there are just a few quantum algorithms, after all. You may wonder how much have changed in the past 20 years. \n",

The most important example is an algorithm for linear systems, discovered by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd and known as HHL algorithm. Another broad class is NISQ algorithms, of which variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are the primary example. Finally, there is a new paradigm emerging, which asks if we can do more with a quantum computer if our data is not classical, but quantum. I will discuss each of them in turn.\n",

    "As far as I can tell, that's basically it. Of course, there have been a great deal of progress since 2003 in finding new applications for the existing primitives, refining their efficiency, and even building unifying frameworks (see e.g. @Martyn2021). But the broad classification outlined above still seems to apply. I list a number of omissions in section @sec-missed, and I'm happy to expand it base on the feedback."

    "# Wait, isn't the quantum advantage already here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going through the list sketched above, let's briefly touch on the quantum advantage experiments. They certainly made a big splash, and call to be addressed. So far, four groups reported quantum advantage. The first and most known result comes from Google @Arute2019, then there were two academic groups in China @Wu2021-@Zhong2020, and last year it was Xanadu @Madsen2022. All these quantum advantage experiments were in *sampling*  tasks, meaning the goal was to sample from a certain probability distribution that is believed to be hard to sample from classically. While debates up to this day continue on whether these quantum advantage experiments can in fact be spoofed by a classical computer, I'm willing to assume that the sampling tasks of this kind give a real and short-term achievable quantum advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, *no useful applications of these sampling tasks* are known. This claim may sound too strong, as there are papers proposing different uses. For example, here is a review from Xanadu on possible applications of the Gaussian Boson Sampling @Bromley2019. Unfortunately, these are only heuristics. I'm not familiar with this subfield in any technical detail, so my argument is a behavioral one. Since these sampling experiments are already available, there is a huge incentive to produce practical results or at least come up with strong theoretical proposals. And this does not seem to be happening. Until I'll see a surge of activity in this area, I'll assume these sampling experiments are unfortunately not useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must admit this is bothering me. We found something, that quantum computers can do better than classical, why can't we use it? There must be a way, right? If we can't, is there a good explanation? I don't know one, but my discomfort was a bit relieved after reading a perspective by Harrow and Montanaro @Harrow2018. There, they introduce sampling experiments as computational analogs of Bell's experiments. Indeed, although [we know](https://idnm.github.io/blog/posts/entanglement/2021-07-12-entanglement.html) that quantum correlations can be stronger than classical, this does not lead directly to useful applications.

There are NISQ algorithms for almost everything -- optimization, machine learning, simulation, and even NISQ versions of algorithms such as factoring or HHL. However, these \"algorithms\" are in fact heuristics that come with many theoretical and practical problems. Let's take a closer look.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variational quantum algorithms\n",
    "The main bundle of NISQ algorithms are variational quantum algorithms (VQA) @Cerezo2020. The two most studied examples are Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). QAOA mostly focuses on ground state preparation for classical Ising Hamiltonians, which in facts covers a huge range of problems related to combinatorial optimization. VQE typically addresses Hamiltonians that arise from physics or chemistry, but largely does the same thing. I think the line between different types of VQA is quite blurry.\n",

    "is minimized by adjusting parameters $\\theta$ classically.\n",

    "Parameterized quantum circuits $U(\\theta)$ can be informed by the problem as in QAOA, which seeks to approximate the adiabatic evolution, or completely problem-agnostic as in Hardware-Efficient ansatze.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is my simple-minded and a bit cynic take on the idea behind variational quantum \"algorithms\", which I think would be better called heuristics. Real quantum algorithms (without quotes) typically require circuits that are very deep. The current generation of quantum devices is pretty inaccurate, errors in two-qubit gates are of the order of $0.1-1\\%$. If you apply many gates, there will be nothing but noise at the output, and the computation is not useful. VQA approach the problem as follows. Alright, we do not know algorithms with shallow circuits, but let's try to build some. We'll prepare a quantum circuit that is sufficiently shallow to have a non-zero signal-to-noise ratio, and introduce *parameters* in there. While we do not know if any values of these parameters correspond to a useful computation, let's try to adjust them (classical optimization loop) so that the circuit does something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean, it is not a bad idea, and in many respects similar to how classical machine learning works. The problem seems to be, the current hardware only allows circuits so shallow, that you may optimize them all you want, no interesting results will follow. Another practical problem is that evaluation of the energy function $E(\\theta)$ requires taking a ton of samples, which is slow and expensive. On the theoretical side, the loss landscape of most VQA appears to be pretty terrible, featuring barren plateaus and many bad local minimums. So even with a perfect hardware, there are no guarantees for good results.\n",

Additional questions you might ask about QML models is whether they have and edge over classical in data encoding, expressivity, generalize better etc. To the best of my understanding, all claims that some QML models are somehow better than classical counterparts are heuristic, inconclusive, or only work for extremely artificial datasets. Moreover, let me quote a recent perspective @Schuld2022 by Schuld and Killoran titled \"Is quantum advantage the right goal for quantum machine learning?\"\n",

So, NISQ algorithms seemed like a low-hanging fruit, but despite all the work of the past years, useful applications have not been demonstrated. Even the industry now seems to become less optimistic about NISQ, and focus more on the fault-tolerant algorithms, and so will we."

By encoding the logical states in many physical qubits it is possible to arbitrarily suppress effective error rates. Asymptotically, the overhead of error correction in terms of physical to logical qubit ratio is polylog, and looks insignificant. However, the constant factors involved can be a dealbreaker. What follows below is my coarse rundown based on papers @Babbush2020 and @Hoefler2023.\n",

Roughly, one magic state is consumed to perform a single non-trivial computational primitive, such as the Toffoli gate. Producing a single magic state involves hundreds of physical qubits, multiple code cycles, and a lot of the classical processing to guide the behavior of the quantum system. Rough estimations show that executing a single Toffoli gate can be 10 *orders* of magnitude slower than executing the NAND gate, its classical counterpart. This looks troublesome, doesn't it?\n",

So this scenario does not look practical, in the end.\n",

Similarly, the output of the algorithm is a quantum state $|x\\rangle$, and not its individual amplitudes. To produce the solution, one needs to apply operator $e^{-iAt}$, which only allows an efficient quantum circuit for very special types of matrices $A$.

My discussion here is mostly based on a short and wonderfully written commentary piece by Scott Aaronson \"Read the fine print\" @Aaronson2015. The big data quantum algorithms aim to provide an exponential speed-up to tasks like matrix inversion, which take polynomial time classically. Which means, quantum algorithms need to be done in logarithmic time. But in general, $\\log N$ time is not even sufficient to read in the problem specification, say $N\\times N$ matrix, or output a full solution, say an $N$-dimensional vector.\n",

There are definitely implications for fundamental science such as probing complicated quantum dynamics, new phases of matter, quantum chaos and so on.

Unfortunately, I am not aware of a rigorous connection between the ability to do quantum simulation and producing practically useful outcomes. So far it seems to be more about exploring the physics/chemistry with the new tools and beyond the regimes the current techniques allow. For this reason, it's not clear that analog quantum simulators, which will be ultimately limited in their accuracy, will have applications beyond basic science @Daley2022.\n",

    "\n",
    "It allows finding eigenvalues and preparing eigenstates of a Hamiltonian $H$, provided one can efficiently implement controlled evolution operators $e^{-iHt}$. Usually, QPE is formulated as an algorithm for finding eigenvalues of a unitary operator $U$ given its eigenstate $|\\lambda\\rangle$ with an unknown eigenvalue. QPE proceeds by applying powers of $U$ ($U, U^2, U^4,\\dots$) to state $|\\lambda\\rangle$, each controlled by its own auxiliary qubit. The state of the auxiliary qubits then contains a lot of information about $\\lambda$, roughly one bit of accuracy per qubit, and this information can be efficiently revealed after performing a quantum Fourier transform on the auxiliary qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the original state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $U$, QPE performs a projective energy measurement. It will output some energy $E$ and prepare the corresponding state $|\\lambda_E\\rangle$ with probability proportional to the overlap of $|\\langle\\psi|\\lambda_E\\rangle|^2$.\n",

    "Quantum phase estimation can yield high-accuracy information about the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian. In many practical questions of quantum chemistry, this exactly what you want to know. There is a caveat, though. Most interesting in practice are ground and low-energy states, and for QPE to reveal information about them, the initial state for the algorithm needs to have sufficiently high overlap with low-energy states. In general this problem is QMA-hard (not expected to be efficiently solvable even on a quantum computer), and whether it is solvable in practical scenarios is still not settled conclusively @Lee2022.\n"

    "## I may have a bias problem\n",
    "Alright, you might have noticed that even this list gets increasingly less rigorous. My investigation, which started as a noble search for truth, quickly turned into a confirmation bias exercise. Indeed, I quite quickly started to err on the side that 'we still don't really know what quantum computers will be good for', and enjoyed finding support for this view. While this may not be a great journalistic work, I still think this point of view is seriously underrepresented and worth voicing. At the same time, I'm really open to changing my mind, as I have all the reasons to want the field to succeed, and the sooner, the better.\n",

    "I must also say that in the long run, a radical impact of quantum computing looks inevitable to me. This is a fundamentally new way of information processing, and this must make a difference. As Scott Aaronson have argued, if for fundamental reasons large scale quantum computers can never be built, it would be a new and revolutionary law of physics. I'd say that similarly, if we could 'prove' that quantum computers can not be useful, this would be a new remarkable law of nature worth discovering. From what we know now, it looks extremely unlikely. However, use cases for truly novel technologies are hard to forecast.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What looks the most promising at the moment?\n",
    "In searching for practical quantum advantage, several requirements need to be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There must be a problem that a quantum computer can solve efficiently.\n",
    "2. Evidence that a classical computer can't.\n",
    "3. Last but not least, the problem must be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, this list is as much about the problem we want to solve as it is about the power of quantum algorithms. And finding the right problems, although possible in theory, turns out to be very challenging in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is exciting to try applying quantum algorithms to problems that appear to have no direct relation to the quantum world whatsoever. Basically, we start with (1) and then try to comply to (2) and (3). Say, we have an idea about how to solve certain large linear systems of equations and then try to find a subset of those that are useful and intractable classically. And while there may be gems on this path, a lot of evidence now shows that finding the right problems of this kind is really tricky. One early impressive success is Shor's algorithm, but It may still be the only well-established example.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, one can tackle obviously quantum-inspired problems. Quite recently, people started to look at cases when the input data is quantum rather than classical, and there the quantum advantage is already established, but no wide uses have been suggested yet. I'd say that the simulation of quantum systems for physics and chemistry appears to be our most grounded proposal for where to look for a practical quantum advantage. It addresses an obviously important problem known to be classically hard by decades of intensive research. So (2) and (3) are covered, and (1) also comes naturally. Indeed, people also often describe quantum simulation as a native task for a quantum computer. I quote an elegant passage from @Daley2022\n",
