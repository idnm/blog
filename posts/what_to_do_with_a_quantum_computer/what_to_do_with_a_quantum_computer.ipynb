    "# Introduction\n",
    "This post will be a bit different from others, in that I'll try to give a high level review instead of diving in detail into a specific topic. Also, since this is my personal blog, I figured I will give some personal background on this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "I got involved in the field of quantum computing relatively recently, in 2021. Before that, I didn't even know the field exists, let alone is taking off at the industrial scale. Yes, that's how robust my bubble was. After switching to quantum, I've tried to catch up on many levels -- from understanding the fundamentals, to getting up to speed with state of the art in hardware and algorithms, to carrying out some original research. Although I made some progress in all directions, you can imagine how fragmented and incomplete my picture of the field is. While there is still a ton of topics I'd like to understand better, one particular question have been sitting on the back of my mind for quite a while. ***What quantum computers will actually be good for?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Asking ChatGPT this precise question I got a pretty long list (click to unfold).\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note title=\"Sure, here's a numbered list of some potential applications of quantum computers:\" appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=true}\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cryptography: Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the currently used encryption methods and could be used to develop new, more secure encryption methods that are resistant to quantum attacks.\n",
    "2. Optimization: Quantum computers could be used to solve optimization problems exponentially faster than classical computers, potentially revolutionizing industries ranging from finance to transportation to healthcare.\n",
    "3. Chemistry and materials science: Quantum computers can simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the quantum level, which could help in the development of new drugs and materials.\n",
    "4. Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Quantum computers could potentially outperform classical computers in tasks such as image and speech recognition, which could have applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles and robotics.\n",
    "5. Financial modeling: Quantum computers could be used to quickly analyze large amounts of financial data and predict stock prices or other market trends.\n",
    "6. Supply chain optimization: Quantum computers could be used to optimize supply chain operations, such as routing and scheduling, to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\n",
    "7. Weather forecasting: Quantum computers could be used to simulate complex weather patterns and improve the accuracy of weather forecasting.\n",
    "8. Energy production: Quantum computers could be used to optimize energy production and distribution, potentially reducing energy costs and improving energy efficiency.\n",
    "9. Particle physics: Quantum computers could be used to analyze data from particle accelerators and help physicists understand the behavior of particles at the subatomic level.\n",
    "10. Transportation: Quantum computers could be used to optimize transportation networks, including traffic flow, route planning, and logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "And indeed, all these topics, and many more, are frequently covered in popular discussions and even technical papers on quantum computing. Probably for an non-expert it would be nearly impossible critically sort through these and resist the impression that quantum computers will be good for everything (and soon!). However, my exposure to the field already made me skeptical about many of the usually proposed applications. And I felt a pressing need to sort this out for myself. I now feel like I've mostly done my homework on this one, and here is what I found. For most of applications people discuss, prospects are pretty bleak. And it seems there is a single clear favorite.  \n",

    "::: {.callout-warning}\n",
    "As mentioned, my expertise in the field is limited. So take my assessment critically. I will cite many other sources, but of course they are subject to my selection bias. Also, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong, more tangible applications is better! Feel free to leave the feedback.\n",

    "# Types of quantum algorithms\n",
    "While there are great many specific versions of quantum algorithms (see a pretty comprehensive list at @zoo), they can be divided in a small number of broad categories. Back in 2003 the one and only Peter Shor wrote a short essay \"Why haven’t more quantum algorithms been found?\" @Shor2003. There he points out three main categories of quantum algorithms that were known to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Those using the quantum Fourier transform to find periodicity. The most famous example is the integer factoring algorithm due to Shor himself.\n",
    "- Algorithms similar or derived from Grover's search.\n",
    "- Algorithms for quantum simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, if you are interested why haven't more quantum algorithms been found, then according to Shor, it is probably because (1) quantum algorithms are so unusual that we do not have a good way to think about and invent them or (2) maybe there is just so much quantum algorithms, after all. You may wonder how much have changed in the past 20 years. \n",
    "Apparently, not that much. I would add three more positions to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HHL algorithm.\n",
    "- NISQ \"algorithms\".\n",
    "- Algorithms for quantum data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To my understanding, the key new addition is the algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, discovered by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd and known as HHL algorithm. Another broad class of algorithms are NISQ algorithms, of which variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are the primary example. Finally, there is a new paradigm emerging which asks if we can do more with a quantum computer if our data is not classical, but quantum. I will discuss each of them in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as far as I can tell, that's basically it. Of course there have been a great deal of progress since 2003 in finding new applications for the existing primitives, refining their efficiency, and even building unifying frameworks (see e.g. @Martyn2021). But the broad classification outlined above still seems to apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What about the quantum advantage experiments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going through the list sketched above, let's briefly touch on the quantum advantage experiments. They certainly made a big splash, and it's important to understand their place in the grand scheme of things. So far, four groups reported quantum advantage. The fist and most known result comes from Google @Arute2019, then there were two academic groups in China @Wu2021-@Zhong2020, and last year it was Xanadu @Madsen2022. All these quantum advantage experiments were in *sampling*  tasks, meaning the goal was to sample from a certain probability distribution that is believed to be hard to sample from classically. While debates up to this day continue on whether these quantum advantage experiments can in fact be spoofed by a classical computer, I'm willing to assume that the sampling tasks of this kind give a real and short-term achievable quantum advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, *no useful applications of these sampling tasks* are known. This claim may sound too strong, as there are papers proposing different uses. For example, here is a review from Xanadu on possible applications of the Gaussian Boson Sampling @Bromley2019. Unfortunately, these are only heuristics. I'm not familiar with this subfield in any technical detail, so my argument is a behavioral one. Since these sampling experiments are already available, there is a huge incentive to produce practical results or at least come up with strong theoretical proposals. And this does not seem to be happening. Until I'll see a surge of activity in this a rea, I'll assume that these sampling experiments are unfortunately not useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must admit that this is bothering me. We found something, that quantum computers can do better than classical, why can't we use it? There must be a way, right? If we can't, is there a good explanation? I don't know one, but my discomfort was a bit relieved after reading a perspective by Harrow and Montanaro @Harrow2018. There, they introduce sampling experiments as computational analogs of Bell's experiments. Indeed, although [we know](https://idnm.github.io/blog/posts/entanglement/2021-07-12-entanglement.html) that quantum correlations can be stronger than classical, this does not lead directly to useful applications. Alright, I'll leave it at that. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# NISQ algorithms don't work\n",
    "\n",
    "Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) algorithms @Bharti2022 account for most of the prospective applications of quantum computing, or at least you can get such an impression. There are NISQ algorithms for almost everything -- optimization, machine learning, simulation, and even NISQ versions of algorithms such as factoring or HHL. However, these \"algorithms\" are in fact heuristics that come with many theoretical and practical problems. Let's take a closer look.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variational quantum algorithms\n",
    "The main category of NISQ algorithms are variational quantum algorithms (VQA). The two most studied examples are Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). QAOA mostly focuses on ground state preparation for classical Ising Hamiltonians, which in facts covers a huge range of problems related to combinatorial optimization. VQE typically addresses Hamiltonians that arise from physics or chemistry, but largely does the same thing. I think the line between different types of VQA is quite blurry.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note title=\"Variational quantum algorithms\" style=\"minimal\" collapse=true}\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite generally, variational quantum algorithms aim to find a low energy state of some Hamiltonian $H$, that encodes the problem of interest. To do this, they start with a trivial quantum state $|0\\rangle$ and apply a parameterized quantum circuit to it $U(\\phi)|0\\rangle$. The resulting energy\n",
    "$$E(\\theta)=\\langle0|U^\\dagger(\\phi)HU(\\phi)|0\\rangle$$\n",
    "is minimized by adjusting parameters $\\theta$ classically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameterized quantum circuits $U(\\theta)$ can be informed by the problem as in QAOA, which seeks to approximate the adiabatic evolution, or completely problem-agnostic as in Hardware-Efficient ansatze.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my simple-minded and a bit cynic take on the idea behind variational quantum \"algorithms\", which I think would be better called variational quantum heuristics. Real quantum algorithms (without quotes) typically require circuits that are very deep. The current generation of quantum devices is pretty inaccurate, errors in two-qubit gates are of the order of $1\\%$. If you apply many gates, there will be nothing but noise at the output, and the computation is not useful. VQA approach the problem as follows. Alright, we do not know algorithms with shallow circuits, but let's try to build some. We'll prepare a quantum circuit that is sufficiently shallow to have a non-zero signal to noise ratio, and introduce *parameters* in there. While we do not know if any values of these parameters correspond to a useful computation, let's try to adjust them (classical optimization loop) so that the circuit does something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean, it is not a bad idea, and in many respects similar to how classical machine learning works. The problem seems to be, the current hardware only allows circuits so shallow, that you may optimize them all you want, you still wont get interesting results. Another practical problem is that evaluation of the energy function $E(\\theta)$ requires taking a ton of samples, which is slow and expensive. On the theoretical side, the loss landscape of most VQA appears to be pretty terrible, featuring barren plateaus and many bad local minimums. So even on a perfect hardware there are no guarantees for good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum machine learning\n",
    ":::{.callout-note title=\"Supervised quantum machine learning models\" style=\"minimal\" collapse=true}\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical quantum model for a supervised learning task looks very similar to VQA instances described above\n",
    "$$E(x,\\theta)=\\langle0|U^\\dagger(x,\\phi) H U(x,\\phi)|0\\rangle$$\n",
    "where part of the parameters $x$ are now not model \"weights\", but instead encode the training data. The rest of the parameters $\\theta$ are to be optimized to yield a better loss $E(x,\\theta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum machine learning (QML) sounds quite fancy, but it shares much of the problems with VQA. Additional questions you might ask about QML models is whether can be superior to classical models at data encoding, expressivity, generalize better etc. To the best of my understanding, all claims that some QML models are somehow better than classical counterparts are heuristic and inconclusive. Moreover, let me quote a recent perspective @Schuld2022 by Schuld and Killoran \n",
    "\n",
    ">Contrary to commercial expectations – machine learning may turn out to be one of the hardest applications to show a practical quantum advantage for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? By all means take a look at the paper if you are interested, but a short answer is that \n",
    "\n",
    ">Quantum machine learning research is trying to beat large, high-performing algorithms for problems that are conceptually hard to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, classical machine learning is so it sets a very high bar; it's hard to theoretically analyze how it works let alone prove quantum advantage; and we can't collect any meaningful empirical data on QML because the hardware is too noisy yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Noisy summary\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more versions of NISQ algorithms beyond VQA and QML. However, they all come with significant challenges. I quote an extensive recent review @Bharti2022\n",
    "\n",
    ">At the moment of documenting this review, there is no known demonstration of industrially relevant quantum advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would add that, to the best of my knowledge, there are also no theoretical guarantees that NISQ algorithms can lead to quantum advantage at all. If you feel like reading another critical review of NISQI recommend this article @Sarma by a renowned condensed matter physicist Sankar Das Sarmaar, and these youtube presentations by Owen Lockwood @LockwoodNISQ-@LockwoodQML, which I found quite instructive. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, NISQ algorithms seemed like a low-hanging fruit, but despite all the work of the past years, useful applications have not been demonstrated. Even the industry now seems to become less optimistic about NISQ, and focus more on the algorithms without quotes, and so will we.\n",
