abstract = {It is expected that quantum computers would enable solving various problems that are beyond the capabilities of the most powerful current supercomputers, which are based on classical technologies. In the last three decades, advances in quantum computing stimulated significant interest in this field from industry, investors, media, executives, and general public. However, the understanding of this technology, its current capabilities and its potential impact in these communities is still lacking. Closing this gap requires a complete picture of how to assess quantum computing devices' performance and estimate their potential, a task made harder by the variety of quantum computing models and physical platforms. Here we review the state of the art in quantum computing, promising computational models and the most developed physical platforms. We also discuss potential applications, the requirements posed by these applications and technological pathways towards addressing these requirements. Finally, we summarize and analyze the arguments for the quantum computing market's further exponential growth. The review is written in a simple language without equations, and should be accessible to readers with no advanced background in mathematics and physics.},

@article{Bharti2022,
abstract = {A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve efficiently problems such as integer factorization and unstructured database search requires millions of qubits with low error rates and long coherence times. While the experimental advancement towards realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e. qubits that are not error-corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations in a limited coherence time. In the search for quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry and combinatorial optimization. The goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms. We discuss the key structure of these algorithms, their limitations, and advantages. We additionally provide a comprehensive overview of various benchmarking and software tools useful for programming and testing NISQ devices.},

@article{Harrow2018,
abstract = {The field of quantum algorithms aims to find ways to speed up the solution of computational problems by using a quantum computer. A key milestone in this field will be when a universal quantum computer performs a computational task that is beyond the capability of any classical computer, an event known as quantum supremacy. This would be easier to achieve experimentally than full-scale quantum computing, but involves new theoretical challenges. Here we present the leading proposals to achieve quantum supremacy, and discuss how we can reliably compare the power of a classical computer to the power of a quantum computer.},

@article{Aaronson2022,
abstract = {I survey, for a general scientific audience, three decades of research into which sorts of problems admit exponential speedups via quantum computers -- from the classics (like the algorithms of Simon and Shor), to the breakthrough of Yamakawa and Zhandry from April 2022. I discuss both the quantum circuit model, which is what we ultimately care about in practice but where our knowledge is radically incomplete, and the so-called oracle or black-box or query complexity model, where we've managed to achieve a much more thorough understanding that then informs our conjectures about the circuit model. I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of switching attention to sampling tasks, as was done in the recent quantum supremacy experiments. I make some skeptical remarks about widely-repeated claims of exponential quantum speedups for practical machine learning and optimization problems. Through many examples, I try to convey the "law of conservation of weirdness," according to which every problem admitting an exponential quantum speedup must have some unusual property to allow the amplitude to be concentrated on the unknown right answer(s).},
