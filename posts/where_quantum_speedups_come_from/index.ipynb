    "\n",
    "A classical bit can be either $0$ or $1$. Similarly, a *qubit* (quantum bit) can be $\\bf{0}$ or $\\bf{1}$. But crucially, a qubit can also be in any state of the form\n",
    "$$\\pmb{s}=a_0 \\pmb{0}+a_1 \\pmb{1} \\ .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, states $\\pmb{0}$ and $\\pmb{1}$ are *vectors*, and (almost) any linear combination of them is a valid state of a qubit. In quantum mechanics a linear combination is called a *superposition*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean for a qubit to be in state $\\pmb{s}$? It means that if you look at it, or *make a measurement* in quantum-mechanical jargon, you will see $\\pmb{0}$ with probability $p_0=|a_0|^2$ or $\\pmb{1}$ with probability $p_1=|a_1|^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this point of view, a qubit in state $\\pmb{s}$ is indistinguishable from a *pbit* (probabilistic) bit that is in the state $0$ with probability $p_0$ and state $1$ with probability $p_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison between p-bits and qubits is very natural, yet often overlooked. Compare qubits to normal determinisitc bits is more apples vs oranges, because the language used to describe them is so different. P-bits, instead, share many of the properties with qubits, such as an exponentially large state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum mechanics is a theory of amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a qubit and a p-bit? Numbers $a_0, a_1$ defining a state $\\pmb{s}$ are called *amplitudes*. They are similar to probabilities, yet can be *negative*. They can (and often are) be complex numbers, but the negative values to depart from classical computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that some quantity can be negative and it is the reason for quantum magic may sound a bit silly, but this is one of the ways to clearly state how quantum and classical differs. Eventually, it can be interpreted that quantum systems can be in ``several plcaes at the same time`` in a qualitatevly different way, compared with probabilistic classical systems.\n",

    "## The Hadamard gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum processes transform quantum states. Importantly, they operate on *amplitudes*, not on probabilities. Trying to interpret a quantum as something that simply changes an underlying probability distribution does not work.\n",

    "In words, it is a linear operation that takes $\\pmb{0}$ to sum $\\pmb{0}+\\pmb{1}$, and takes $\\pmb{1}$ to difference $\\pmb{0}-\\pmb{1}$. The factors $\\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}$ are needed to ensure that the total probability is 1. If you measure the state $|+\\rangle$ you get $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ with the same probability $\\frac12$. The same holds for $|-\\rangle$, i.e. states $|\\pm\\rangle$ are indistinguishable from this point of view. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simple classical analog to the Hadamard transformation -- a coin flip, which I will cal $C$! Indeed, independent of the initial state, a fair flip of a fair coin will produce a p-bit which is equally likely to be 0 and 1. Can you interpret the Hadamard transform in the same way? No, not really. If you apply the Hadamard transform twice, it will be very different from two coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, applying $C$ the second time does nothing, and you are still maximally uncertain about the state of your bit. However, applying the Hadamard transform twice gives you back the original state! For instance\n",

This is because to get the probability $p(A\\to C)$ you sum intermediate *probabilities*, which can not be negative, so \n",

    "## But why can't we simulate the amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "One often hears that the state space of many qubits is exponentially large, and hence can not be simulated classically. While necessary, this is not sufficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "A state of $n$ qubits is described by $2^n$ (complex) numbers, each being an aplitude of a particular bit configuration. E.g. for three qubits there are 8 amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = a_{000}|000\\rangle + a_{001}|001\\rangle+a_{010}|010\\rangle+a_{011}|011\\rangle+a_{100}|100\\rangle + a_{101}|101\\rangle+a_{110}|110\\rangle+a_{111}|111\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the state space of probabilistic classical bits is exponentially large as well. There are $2^n$ possible configurations of $n$ classical bits, each having an associated probability. E.g. for three bits we need to specify $p_{000}$ trough $p_{111}$ to specify the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    " Namely, if you have $n$ p-bits, to fully describe the state of the system you need to specify the probability of each configuration, such as $p_{1010001\\dots}$, and there are $2^n$ such probabilities (yes, there are only $2^n-1$ independent ones, as the total should be one, but don't be picky). Yet, we can efficiently simulate probabilistic processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "By a probabilistic process I mean a series of transformation steps, each of which can have randomness to it. Say at first we randomly flip the first bit. Then we reverse the value of the second bit, but only if first bit is 1. While this is a deterministic operation, it will make the state of the second qubit uncertain, because it is now conditioned on the state of the first randomly flipped bit. And so on. While this does not look like a code in python, it is a valid model of probabilistic computation, which looks similar to gate-based quantum computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compose enough of such simple steps, and the complexity of the resulting probability distribution can be high. I.e. the probabilities of any\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we do not need to keep track of the exponential number of trajectories to get from the initial to the final state. We can simply sample individual trajectories. You should think of a probabilistic process as a sequence of probabilistic changes to the state of the system. For example, if step number 100 requires flipping the last bit, it gives rise to two new possibilities (one where the last bit is 0, and another where it is 1). But we can simply choose 0 or 1 for the last bit at random, and ignore the other option. Doing this for all steps making up the probabilistic process, we obtain a final sample. Repeating this procedure many time over, produces samples of the whole process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because the classical probability simply reflects our ignorance about the exact state. But in each realization of a random process there was a single actual state at each moment, and we can simulate its transformation step by step, as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This does *not* work for quantum processes. Here is an extreme yet practical example. Many quantum algorithms work in such a way, that by the end of the procedure, the bit string corresponding encoding the correct answer has probability close to 1. Running such an algorithm a bunch of times on a real quantum computer will result in the correct answer with very high probability.  \n",

    "We can sample a single trajectory and compute its *amplitude*, but this does not allow us to sample the from \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be more precise. Say a probabilistic process (or computation) is a sequence of steps $S_1, S_2, \\dots S_k$. If we can *sample* from the output of each step $S_i$ provided an input state, we can simulate the whole process. For example, say $S_i$ consists in randomly flipping the second bit. Then, an initial state $s_0s_1s_2\\dots$ is transformed to $s_0 0 s_1\\dots$ or to $s_0 1 s_1\\dots$ with probability one half each. \n",
