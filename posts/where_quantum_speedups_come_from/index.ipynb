I don't think this is doable without any math, but I will only rely on a minimal background in linear algebra, basic probability, and elementary complexity theory (understanding why an algorithm taking $\\sqrt{N}$ steps is better than the one taking $N$ steps suffices). There are two points to address.\n",

    "Quantum computing is not really about physics. Rather, quantum mechanics can be understood as a generalization of the probability theory. Standard probability theory deals with probabilities, which are positive numbers. Quantum mechanics instead deals with probability *amplitudes*. Probability amplitudes, when squared, give proper probabilities. But amplitudes can be both positive or negative (or even complex numbers, but this won't matter much). In a sense, all quantum weirdness can be attributed to this seemingly superficial distinction.\n",

    "There is more than one way to highlight the difference between classical and quantum. Comparing them head-to-head is tricky, simply because we usually use very different language to describe the two. Here, I will focus on comparing quantum mechanics with classical probability theory. Some features often perceived as unique to quantum systems, such as the exponentially large state space, are in fact present in probabilistic systems as well. Overall, it makes for a fairer apples-to-apples kind of comparison."

In other words, if there are several possibilities to reach an end state, they reinforce each other. In a quantum process, it is the amplitudes that sum up, and they can *cancel* each other. The fact that there is some trajectory (with a non-zero amplitude) leading to some end state, does not mean that this end state is in fact reachable. The amplitude of this trajectory can be canceled by others. This is known as a *quantum interference*. (If you are familiar, this is what the famous two-slit experiment shows.

    "\n",
    "You may find our discussion of the $H$ gate unmotivated or unnatural. Why is this gate defined the way it does? What does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The $H$ gate was only used to give a simple illustration of quantum interference. We could have used almost any other quantum process instead. A probabilistic classical processes only needs to preserve the total probability, and the same is true for a quantum process. More precisely, a quantum process needs to be linear and preserve the property that the squares of the amplitudes sum up to one. The $H$ gate has this property, it is a simple and valid quantum process. Mathematically, it is a unitary matrix $H=\\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$. Conversely, any unitary matrix represents a quantum process. Almost all unitary matrices feature negative or complex entries, and hence exhibit the amplitude-cancelling behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is yet another way to introduce $H$ gate. Any classical boolean function (i.e. a classical computation) can be expressed as a sequence of simple gates. For example, NAND [ref] gate is universal, meaning that an arbitrary classical computation can be expressed as a sequence of NAND gates alone. Probably a less familiar option is the Toffoli gate [ref], which takes three bits as an input, and inverts the third bit if the first two bits are \"on\". The Toffoli gate is universal for classical computation, and has the nice property that it is reversible (and in particular is its own inverse). Reversible classical gates can be easily implemented on a quantum computer. However, the Toffoli gate is not universal for *quantum* computation. Indeed, it merely shuffles the bitstings, and can not create a superposition like $|+\\rangle$. However, supplementing the Toffoli gate with (almost) any other quantum gate that *can* create superpositions makes for a universal gate set. In particular, Toffoli+H is a universal quantum gate set. So in a sense, $H$ gate can capture all the quantumness there is. (Note however, that this is true for almost any other choice of an additional gate.)\n",

The amplitudes here have the same meaning as for a single qubit. For instance, $|a_{101}|^2$ is the probability to find the first and third qubits in state $|1\\rangle$, and the second qubit in state $|0\\rangle$, upon measuring. For three qubits there are $8$ possible states, and $8$ amplitudes. For $n$ qubits, there are $2^n$ possible bit-strings and $2^n$ amplitudes (subject to the total probability equals one condition). This exponential dimension of the state space is often cited as *the origin* of the quantum speedups. Yet, it is only a part of the story.\n",

    "Indeed, while the number of qubits $n$ is small enough, so that the dimension of the state space $2^n$ is manageable, any quantum process can be simulated. This is known as state-vector simulation, and it only requires being able to store and update a vector of dimension $2^n$ (currently, up to roughly $n=50$ qubits can be simulated by this brute-force approach.).\n",

Indeed, to specify the probability distribution over $n$ classical bits, one needs to provide $2^n$ probabilities corresponding to each possible bit string. For instance, to describe a probability distribution over three bits, one needs to specify eight probabilities $p_{000}$ through $p_{111}$."

    "# Why quantum interference defies classical simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to explain why some quantum computations can not be efficiently simulated by a classical computer. Imagine a quantum computer that manipulates $n$ qubits. It runs a quantum algorithm that outputs a quantum state. This particular algorithm produces a quantum state that is not a superposition, but a particular bitstring such as $|\\psi\\rangle=|00101\\dots\\rangle$. This bitstring *is* (or encodes) the solution to our problem. (Not all quantum algorithms are like that, but some are, to a good approximation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also think of a quantum algorithm as consisting of a number of simple quantum operations. Say it is a sequence of $H$ and Toffoli gates, which are universal for quantum computation. Mathematically, you can get the output state by taking the initial state, representing it as a vector, and applying matrices of various quantum gates constituting the algorithm to this vector. As discussed, this works for $n$ sufficiently small, but eventually breaks down because the memory required scales exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine a similar scenario in a classical probabilistic world. Someone comes up with a classical probabilistic algorithm that produces a correct result with probability 1. In fact, directly simulating this algorithm by keeping track of the probabilities of different bitstrings at all steps may be equally intractable, because the number of possible bitstrings is exponentially large. But we do not need to do that. We know that the algorithm outputs the correct solution with probability one, i.e. the correct solution is reached by *all* trajectories having a non-zero probability. We simply need to simulate a single such trajectory, and see where it ends up. Classical probabilities don't cancel, they reinforce each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not work for quantum amplitudes. We can certainly find a trajectory with non-zero amplitude. But there is no guarantee that this trajectory leads to the correct result, because its amplitude can get cancelled by other trajectories. Accounting for all possible trajectories, you can determine the true probability of reaching that particular end state. Of course, generally there are exponentially many trajectories, and this is not feasible. (Incidentally, this view gives a different simulation technique. Keeping track of the total state vector requires exponential memory, but is time-efficient. In contrast, the total amplitude for reaching a particular end state can be computed by summing trajectories one by one. This requires little memory, but an exponential number of steps.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A concluding remark is in order here. Neither quantum nor classical probabilistic algorithms need to produce a definite bitsting. In general, different runs produce different results, corresponding to some probability distribution. In that case, the simulation should only be capable of producing individual outcomes, or *samples*, that are described by the same distribution. This is easy to achieve in the classical probabilistic case. We simply sample one trajectory at a time, period. Ultimately, this works because though we *describe* our system as if it could be in different states at the same time step, this only makes sense for different runs of the algorithm. During a single run a classical system can really only be in a single state at a single time.\n",

So you have a boolean function of a single bit $f(x)$ (i.e. $f$ takes 0 or 1 and returns 0 or 1). There are two mutually exclusive possibilities, either $f(0)=f(1)$, or $f(0) != f(1)$.

The problem is, if $f(0)=f(1)$ this $\\widetilde{U}_f$ is not reversible, which is a problem for a quantum computer. $U_f$, on the other hand, is always reversible. While the definition of $U_f$ may not be the first thing that comes to mind, it's really the simplest way to define a transformation that treats states with $f(x)=0$ and $f(x)=1$ differently, while being reversible.\n",

    "Ok, let's start getting technical. Quantum computers manipulate quantum states. What are these? The simplest quantum system, known as a ***qubit*** (from ***qu***antum ***bit***), has two basic states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. However, it can also be in ***superposition*** of these\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle=a|0\\rangle+b|1\\rangle \\ .$$\n",
    "What does is mean for a qubit to be in this state? If you ask the qubit, i.e. make a ***measurement***, it will answer \"I'm $|0\\rangle$!\" with probability $|a|^2$ and \"I'm $|1\\rangle$!\") with probability $|b|^2$. Of course, we need to have $|a|^2+|b|^2=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this respect, qubit in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is like an unfair coin, which lands heads with probability $|a|^2$ and tails with probability $|b|^2$. Importantly, this probability distribution is not a property of the qubit itself, but \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, $a$ and $b$ can be complex numbers, but for simplicity you can think they are just the usual real numbers. What is important, is that they can be negative.\n",
